2. Using the â€˜date_addedâ€™ column, a new column called â€˜year_addedâ€™ only has the year the title was added.
3. Using the â€˜date_addedâ€™ column, create a new column called â€˜month_addedâ€™ that only has the month the title was added.
4. Check the data types. Does anything look odd? Adjust accordingly.
5. What is the most popular release year for movies on Netflix?
6. In what year did Netflix add the most content to its platform?
7. What is the movie with the longest title in the dataset?
8. What are the top 5 most popular movie genres?
9. Create a pie chart visualizing the proportion of movies vs TV shows. Label each section with the percentage.
